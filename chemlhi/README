BioLhi script changing routines:
separate_dep_dist
intersect
make_line
unshared_copy
diff
change_line





















This is the code that will change a bio lhi file. The dependencies in a bio lhi file a a little bit more
complicated than the dependencies in a chemical lhi file. These files specify a dependency as

Level number
*stuff*
depends = level1*nodes1, level2*nodes2, ..., leveln, nodesn
dep1 : distribution
dep2 : distribution
etc.

The dep lines are in the format a,b,c,d-e,f,g,h - etc. where the a, b, etc. specify the nodes in the levels indicated in 'depends'. The troubles with this format are:
	1. The dependency level and nodes are listed on different lines
	2. The a, b, c, described above need not be consecutive (I'm not sure if they are ordered).
	3. The dependency is split all the way to the last node. For example, a dependency string in level n specifies a 
		distribution for the levels own nodes. In the chem lhi files, the end of a dependency string is always 
		n(a-b) where a-b is the entire range of nodes in level n. In the bio file, we may have a different distribution
		for different nodes within a terminal level.
		For example, the chem files specify constant distributions if the probability of each node is a fixed number. 
		In the bio file, this fixed number is specified as a delta for each of the nodes. 
		Why is this complicated? It isn't complicated, but it is potentially dangerous. If we change one of the 
		deltas, but forget to change the others, we may wind up with our probabilities not summing to one.

	As of now, I am not planning on including error checking for the scenario described in bullet 3. That will 
	come later.For now, I am going to allow the user to specify a distribution he or she wants to change, and then 
	the code will like for a superset of the dependency string indicated. That is what will be changed regardless
	of if it is statistically legal or not!
